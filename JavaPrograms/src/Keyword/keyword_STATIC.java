		/*Static â€“ can use in both methods and variables
Static methods and variables can be directly accessible without objects
Main is also a static method, and we can access non static method and variables using objects
Non static method has no restriction, we can access static/non static methods and variables (eg: regular method outside the main method)
access static variable of another class is also possible without objects. For that,  we have to use classname (anotherclassname.variable)
INTREVIEW QUESTIONS example for static : (System.out.println->System is a predefined class, contains an static out variable and println is a static method)
